        "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).\n",

Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)_"
