    "text": "1. Estimating Yogurt Preferences\n\nLikelihood for the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) Model\nSuppose we have \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) consumers who each select exactly one product \\(j\\) from a set of \\(J\\) products. The outcome variable is the identity of the product chosen \\(y_i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, J\\}\\) or equivalently a vector of \\(J-1\\) zeros and \\(1\\) one, where the \\(1\\) indicates the selected product. For example, if the third product was chosen out of 4 products, then either \\(y=3\\) or \\(y=(0,0,1,0)\\) depending on how we want to represent it. Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product \\(x_j\\) (eg, size, price, etc.).\nWe model the consumer’s decision as the selection of the product that provides the most utility, and we’ll specify the utility function as a linear function of the product characteristics:\n\\[ U_{ij} = x_j'\\beta + \\epsilon_{ij} \\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is an i.i.d. extreme value error term.\nThe choice of the i.i.d. extreme value error term leads to a closed-form expression for the probability that consumer \\(i\\) chooses product \\(j\\):\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}_i(j) = \\frac{e^{x_j'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\\beta}} \\]\nFor example, if there are 4 products, the probability that consumer \\(i\\) chooses product 3 is:\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{e^{x_1'\\beta} + e^{x_2'\\beta} + e^{x_3'\\beta} + e^{x_4'\\beta}} \\]\nA clever way to write the individual likelihood function for consumer \\(i\\) is the product of the \\(J\\) probabilities, each raised to the power of an indicator variable (\\(\\delta_{ij}\\)) that indicates the chosen product:\n\\[ L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^{\\delta_{i1}} \\times \\ldots \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(J)^{\\delta_{iJ}}\\]\nNotice that if the consumer selected product \\(j=3\\), then \\(\\delta_{i3}=1\\) while \\(\\delta_{i1}=\\delta_{i2}=\\delta_{i4}=0\\) and the likelihood is:\n\\[ L_i(\\beta) = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(2)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(3)^1 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(4)^0 = \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\\beta}} \\]\nThe joint likelihood (across all consumers) is the product of the \\(n\\) individual likelihoods:\n\\[ L_n(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} \\]\nAnd the joint log-likelihood function is:\n\\[ \\ell_n(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^J \\delta_{ij} \\log(\\mathbb{P}_i(j)) \\]\n\n\nYogurt Dataset\nWe will use the yogurt_data dataset, which provides anonymized consumer identifiers (id), a vector indicating the chosen product (y1:y4), a vector indicating if any products were “featured” in the store as a form of advertising (f1:f4), and the products’ prices (p1:p4). For example, consumer 1 purchased yogurt 4 at a price of 0.079/oz and none of the yogurts were featured/advertised at the time of consumer 1’s purchase. Consumers 2 through 7 each bought yogurt 2, etc.\ntodo: import the data, maybe show the first few rows, and describe the data a bit.\nLet the vector of product features include brand dummy variables for yogurts 1-3 (we’ll omit a dummy for product 4 to avoid multi-collinearity), a dummy variable to indicate if a yogurt was featured, and a continuous variable for the yogurts’ prices:\n\\[ x_j' = [\\mathbbm{1}(\\text{Yogurt 1}), \\mathbbm{1}(\\text{Yogurt 2}), \\mathbbm{1}(\\text{Yogurt 3}), X_f, X_p] \\]\nThe “hard part” of the MNL likelihood function is organizing the data, as we need to keep track of 3 dimensions (consumer \\(i\\), covariate \\(k\\), and product \\(j\\)) instead of the typical 2 dimensions for cross-sectional regression models (consumer \\(i\\) and covariate \\(k\\)).\nWhat we would like to do is reorganize the data from a “wide” shape with \\(n\\) rows and multiple columns for each covariate, to a “long” shape with \\(n \\times J\\) rows and a single column for each covariate. As part of this re-organization, we’ll add binary variables to indicate the first 3 products; the variables for featured and price are included in the dataset and simply need to be “pivoted” or “melted” from wide to long.\ntodo: reshape and prep the data\n\n\nEstimation\ntodo: Code up the log-likelihood function.\ntodo: Use optim() in R or optimize() in Python to find the MLEs for the 5 parameters (\\(\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\beta_f, \\beta_p\\)). (Hint: you should find 2 positive and 1 negative product intercepts, a small positive coefficient estimate for featured, and a large negative coefficient estimate for price.)\n\n\nDiscussion\nWe learn…\ntodo: interpret the 3 product intercepts (which yogurt is most preferred?).\ntodo: use the estimated price coefficient as a dollar-per-util conversion factor. Use this conversion factor to calculate the dollar benefit between the most-preferred yogurt (the one with the highest intercept) and the least preferred yogurt (the one with the lowest intercept). This is a per-unit monetary measure of brand value.\nOne benefit of the MNL model is that we can simulate counterfactuals (eg, what if the price of yogurt 1 was $0.10/oz instead of $0.08/oz).\ntodo: calculate the market shares in the market at the time the data were collected. Then, increase the price of yogurt 1 by $0.10 and use your fitted model to predict p(y|x) for each consumer and each product (this should be a matrix of \\(N \\times 4\\) estimated choice probabilities. Take the column averages to get the new, expected market shares that result from the $0.10 price increase to yogurt 1. Do the yogurt 1 market shares decrease?"

How many choice tasks did each respondent complete? How many alternatives were presented on each choice task? For each alternative.\nThe attributes (levels) were number of seats (6,7,8), cargo space (2ft, 3ft), engine type (gas, hybrid, electric), and price (in thousands of dollars).\n\n\nModel\ntodo: estimate a MNL model omitting the following levels to avoide multicollinearity (6 seats, 2ft cargo, and gas engine). Include price as a continuous variable. Show a table of coefficients and standard errors. You may use your own likelihood function from above, or you may use a function from a package/library to perform the estimation.\n\n\nResults\ntodo: Interpret the coefficients.
